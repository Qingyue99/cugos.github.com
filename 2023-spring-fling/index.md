        We are currently putting together the program. If you are interested in giving a presentation head over to our
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1avaQk5vkQZ1AcP2JbCgrY4dvL5a8-EUd25IbjaA0Yas/edit?pli=1">"Call for proposals"</a> page. Note in case we would have an overwhelming number of submissions we might add a CUGOS presentation track on Saturday April 22nd (which would run in parallel to the OSM Hackathon-OpenSidewalks Project).
