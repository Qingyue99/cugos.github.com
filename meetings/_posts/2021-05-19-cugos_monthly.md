**[Brandon Liu](https://twitter.com/bdon)** will talk about [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/blog/new-way-to-make-maps), a new vector basemap system for the web. The end goal of Protomaps is to make custom OpenStreetMap cartography and map hosting dead simple. He’ll talk about how a few new components — a spatial database, a serverless file format and map renderer — fit into the overall picture.
