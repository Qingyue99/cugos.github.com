**We** will have the '23 CUGOS board elections and dive into discussing plans for our two day Spring Fling (mini conference) event on April 21/22 2023, and plan ahead for our next meetings. 

**We** can collect input from participants (e.g. on the white board) about any projects/topics people are working on, and possible challenges they are facing. A group discussion can help everyone to learn (new) workflows, approaches and tools others are using.

**[Karsten Vennemann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karstenvennemann/)** will give an update on a QGIS map of his bike travels (and his experimental work on trying to produce better hill shades for cartography purposes [inspired by wanderingcartographer](https://wanderingcartographer.wordpress.com/tag/raster-chunk-processing/)

**[Lisa Enns](https://www.ennsanalytics.com)** will talk about using OSM and QGIS network analysis to discover what amenities are available within 15 minutes via shared and nonmotorized transportation.

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.
