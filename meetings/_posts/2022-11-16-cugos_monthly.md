**[Karsten Vennemann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karstenvennemann/)** will give an update on his experimental work on trying to produce better hillshades for cartography purposes [inspired by wanderingcartographer](https://wanderingcartographer.wordpress.com/tag/raster-chunk-processing/)

Karsten will also show an easy way to get familiar with gdal/ogr commands and advantage of these awsome tools for batch processing of raster and vector data.

**We** can collect input from participants (e.g. on the white board) about any projects/topics people are working on, and possible challenges they are facing. A group discussion can help everyone to learn (new) workflows, approaches and tools others are using.

**We** will disucss plans for hosting a Spring Fling (mini conference) event in April 2023, and plan ahead for our next meetings. Big news is that with the help of **[Peter Keum](https://github.com/keum)** we have secured a venue at UW and are currently finalizing setting a date for April 2023. Next steps will be cordinating settings upa program (call fro presnetations), contact sponsors ...

**Anyone** interested is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.
