**We** will de discussing plans for our two day Spring Fling (mini conference) event on April 21-22 2023, and plan ahead for our next meetings. The evolving event web page is at https://cugos.org/2023-spring-fling/.

The official deadline for our [Call for Presentations for the Spring Fling](https://forms.gle/fXFtj2hnG6PYyLuN9) has passed on Friday March 10. However, if you have a topic you would want to present and need some extra days to submit an abstract just let us know. For the time being you can still submit proposals for talks/presentations via the web form. Please feel free to pass on to anyone you know who might want to give a talk!

**Matt Stevenson** will share a preview of his Spring Fling lightning talk about using R Studio to generate spatially balanced sampling sites for surveying the endangered Streaked Horned Lark in the Willamette Valley of Oregon.  

**Karsten Vennemannn** will show a variety of live map demos (based on a web mapping viewer, internally called *base viewer*) he has worked on together with Eldan Goldenberg over the last 1.5 years. Base viewer is based on Openlayers (compiled via Node package manager), MapServer and PostGIS.  

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.
