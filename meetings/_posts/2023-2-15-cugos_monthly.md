**We** will de discussing plans for our two day Spring Fling (mini conference) event on April 21/22 2023, and plan ahead for our next meetings. 

**We** can collect input from participants (e.g. on the white board) about any projects/topics people are working on, and possible challenges they are facing. A group discussion can help everyone to learn (new) workflows, approaches and tools others are using.

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.

[Add yourself here.](https://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com/blob/master/meetings/_posts/2023-1-18-cugos_monthly.md) or reach out to us hello@cugos.org
