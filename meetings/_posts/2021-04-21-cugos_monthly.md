**[Daniel Dufour](https://github.com/danieljdufour)** will introduce [geotiff.io](https://geotiff.io/) and [geoblaze](https://geoblaze.io), two open-source projects about realizing the scalability and power of true server-free processing.  GeoBlaze is a blazing fast raster analysis engine written in pure JavaScript.  GeoTIFF.io is a completely client-side application that uses GeoBlaze and allows people to visualize and analyze GeoTIFFs.
