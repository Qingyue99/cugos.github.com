# CUGOS Scholarship

## We are in the process to establish a scholarship fund 

The details of this scholarship program are still to be worked out and will need approval by the CUGOS board.
The overall idea is that each year CUGOS membership will vote to award one or more scholarship grants in support of ongoing <a href"https://www.osgeo.org/projects/">OSGEO projects</a> (funding availaiblity permitting). For example such projects include -  but are not limited to - QGIS, PostGIS, MapServer, GDAL/OGR and OpenLayers.

The details of the award application process and selection of suitable students will need to be determined by the CUGOS board.
