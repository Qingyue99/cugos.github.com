# CUGOS Scholarship

## We are in the process of establishing a scholarship fund 

The details of this scholarship program are still being worked out and will need approval by the CUGOS board.
The overall idea is that each year the CUGOS membership will vote to award one or more scholarship grants in support of ongoing <a href"https://www.osgeo.org/projects/">OSGEO projects</a> (based on funding availaiblity). Such projects might include but are not limited to:  QGIS, PostGIS, MapServer, GDAL/OGR and OpenLayers.

The details of the scholarship application process and selection criteria for eligible students will be determined by the CUGOS board. Stay tuned for updates!
