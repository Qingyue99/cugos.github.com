# CUGOS Open Source Software Development Grant

## We are in the process to establish a software development fund 

The details of this grant are still to be worked out and will need approval by the CUGOS board.
The overall idea is that each year CUGOS membership will vote to award an Open Source Software Development Grant to suport sepcific, dedicated work in one or more for ongoing <a href"https://www.osgeo.org/projects/">OSGEO projects</a> (funding availaiblity permitting). 

The selection to which project to dedicate the funds to, along with details about the subject and deliverables for the dedicated work will be determined each year by a open discussion and vote of the CUGOS members. 

The amount of funding to be awarded (and to which suitable entity to perform the work) will need to be approved by a vote of the CUGOS board.
