Scholarship
=====

## We are in the process to establish a scholarship fund 

The details of this scholarship program are still to be worked out and will need approval by the CUGOS board.
The overall idea is that each year CUGOS membership will vote to award one or more student scholarship grants in support of ongoing <a href="https://www.osgeo.org/projects/">OSGEO projects</a> (funding availaiblity permitting). For example such projects include -  but are not limited to - QGIS, PostGIS, MapServer, GDAL/OGR and OpenLayers.

The details of the award application process and selection of suitable students will need to be determined by the CUGOS board.

OS Software Development Grant
=======

## We are in the process to establish an open source software development fund 

The details of this grant are still to be worked out and will need approval by the CUGOS board.
The overall idea is that each year CUGOS membership will vote to award an Open Source Software Development Grant to suport specific, dedicated work in one or more ongoing <a href="https://www.osgeo.org/projects/">OSGEO projects</a> (funding availaiblity permitting). 

The selection to which project to dedicate the funds to, along with details about the subject and deliverables for the dedicated work will be determined each year by a open discussion and vote of the CUGOS members. 

The amount of funding to be awarded (and which suitable entity to perform the work wil be selected) will need to be approved by a vote of the CUGOS board each year.
