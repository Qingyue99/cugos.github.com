* The February meeting will be completely online, the March meeting will be in person if possible
* Karsten suggested reaching out to the membership, and ask them to add topics they're interested in, or suggest speakers, or types of speakers we should seek out--3 differnet things! For example "I'd like to hear more about using R for geospatial" or "i'd like to integrate Python with R" so we find out what people want to learn about, or which people.  How do we solicit suggestions? Brendan suggested using Google Forms
